**Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning**

This repository contains a machine learning project that detects breast cancer using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier. The model is built using Python and trained on the breast cancer dataset provided by scikit-learn.

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on medical features using an SVM model.

** Tools & Libraries**
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

** Dataset**
The dataset is imported from `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`, which contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass.

**Workflow**
- Load and analyze the dataset
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Apply feature scaling
- Train SVM classifier
- Evaluate model performance

**Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy score
- Classification report
- Confusion matrix visualization

**Results**
The trained SVM model achieves good accuracy in predicting breast cancer cases.
